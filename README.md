# Complex Component Consortium

The `Complex Component Consortium` is an association working to improve the usability of [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) by providing high level user interface components.

If you want to make a FOSS [Slack](https://slack.com/) clone, it is our mission to provide you with a `chat` component that can preview links, include a youtube or spotify player, show emojis and all the rest - fully customizeable to your needs and underlaying platform.

## Mission statement

Our mission is to futher the use of [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and improve the quality and usability of such software by providing quality high level user interface components for them to use. 

## Complex Components

`Complex components` are parts of a user interface that have quite complex functionality and/or interaction. Traditionally a component is a low level building block that can be composed to build larger, more complex components. Complex components are not like that. They are more high level serving a specific purpose. They can still be included in your application and customized.

The reason we want to address this issue is that we see alot of high quality FOSS with low quality user interfaces. This makes it hard to get end-users using FOSS and is just terrible in general for everyone. We can do better!

## Technologies

## Example

## Future work

* Lot's of components for everyone :tada: :rocket:
* Separate `<Component />` language that can transpile to other markup (React, ReactNative, DOM, etc.)
